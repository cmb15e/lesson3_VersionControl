            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System (VCS) is essentially a backup system that ensures that will keep track of all the changes you have made to a file. If you are to ever lose any of your file, the VCS will have all of the changes that you have made saved, so the file is really never lost. VCS is particularly interesting to me, because in this course I will be editing various files. I am always nervous when working on projects that I will lose everything that I have worked on and have to restart the entire project. The VCS will ensure that any project that I work on in this course will always be saved.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git started out when the relationship between the people who created the Linux kernel open source software project and BitKeeper diminished. BitKeeper started charging for their services and the Linux kernel community was forced to develop their own repository services. They based their system on that of BitKeeper and actually improved it into what we now call Git. It is interesting to me how Git was created out of necessity for a free repository service. It is important to know the history of Git in this course, because we will be frequently using it throughout the semester and should know its origins.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this lesson, we learned about three basic Git commands that allow the user to create a local Git repository. These commands are $ git init, $ git add ., and $ git commit â€“m. These commands are the basis of using GitHub as a repository and will help me in the future when working on projects. It is vital to know these commands for this class, because we will be using them in order to create a local repository through GitHub for each project. I find it amazing that just by typing in these commands, Cloud9 knows to also save my work to the local GitHub repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Changing Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to ensure that changes are being recorded in the Git repository, there are multiple Git commands that you must use. You can use $ git status in order to check the save status of your files. You can start tracking a new file by using the command $ git add. You will now be able to see if the changes you have made are saved, live.  I will use these commands when using my GitHub repository throughout the course of the semester. It is important to remember these commands so that I can constantly check to see if the changes I have made to a file are being recorded to the repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the repository service that we will be using in this course. It is the most used host for Git repositories, bringing in millions of users. GitHub is easy to set up and to connect to files. Basically all you have to do is give some basic account information such as your email address and the username connected to your workspace, and you will be able to use GitHub as your local repository. GitHub setup is extremely important to this class, because I need to make sure that I set up my account properly so that I can easily use GitHub throughout the course of the semester.</p>
